# # My Python Learning Repository

## Overview

I'm using this repository to keep track of my learning of Python scripts. This repository contains Python scripts organized into two directories, each serving a different purpose. The scripts are designed to address various tasks, and this README provides an overview of the contents and usage of each directory.

## Directories

### Directory 1: `Assignment1`

- Description: This directory includes one csv file in which student data is there and one pythonscript that performs various operation on that csv file
- [/Assignment1](https://github.com/mercury-5/Python_Scripts/tree/main/Assignment1)

#### Included Python Scripts

- `add_nums.py`: This scripts asks the user to give three numbers as inputs and prints the sum of those numbers.
- `array_to_string.py`: This script takes a string as an input and converts that into array and converts that array back into string.
- `bin_conv.py`: This script takes a binary number as input and converts that into decimal and octal, and performs 1's & 2's compliment on that number.
- `check_highest.py`: This script asks the user to enter multiple numbers and returns the highest number of them all.
- `check_prime.py`: This script checks if the user input number is prime or not.
- `fibonacci_srs.py`: This script generates Fibonacci series upto the limit provided by the user.
-  `ip_gen.py`: This script generates IPv4 addresses within a provided range.
- `ip_validation.py`: This script validates if the user input ip is valid or not.
- `prime_in_range.py`: This script prints the prime numbers between two numbers.
- `sort_string.py`: This script sorts the user input string in ascending & descending order.

### Directory 2: `Assignment2`

- Description: This directory includes one csv file in which student data is there and one pythonscript that performs various operation on that csv file
- [/Assignment2](https://github.com/mercury-5/Python_Scripts/tree/main/Assignment2)

#### Included Python Scripts

- `data_handler.py`: This Python script provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with a student database stored in a CSV file. It is designed to facilitate a wide range of operations related to student records, including data retrieval, analysis, and management.
- `database.csv`: This csv file contains all the data about the students

### Directory 3: `Assignment3`

- Description: This directory includes several python scripts like a random password generator, a password checker, sentence tranformer and a restaurant billing script.
- [/Assignment3](https://github.com/mercury-5/Python_Scripts/tree/main/Assignment3)

#### Included Python Scripts

- `restaurant_billing_script.py`: This script takes the menu inforamtion from the csv file and takes order from the user and according to the order it prepares the bill with 18% GST.
- `restaurant_menu.csv`: This csv file contains all the restaurant menu inforamtion.
- `password_checker.py`: This script checks the entered password matches the required criteria or not.
- `random_password.py`: This script generates a random password.
- `sentence_transform`: This script performs some transformation upon the user entered text
