# # My Python Learning Repository

## Overview

I'm using this repository to keep track of my learning of Python scripts. This repository contains Python scripts organized into two directories, each serving a different purpose. The scripts are designed to address various tasks, and this README provides an overview of the contents and usage of each directory.

## Directories

### Directory 1: `Assignment2`

- Description: This directory includes one csv file in which student data is there and one pythonscript that performs various operation on that csv file
- [https://github.com/mercury-5/Python_Scripts/tree/main/Assignment2](/Assignment2)

#### Included Python Scripts

- `data_handler.py`: This Python script provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with a student database stored in a CSV file. It is designed to facilitate a wide range of operations related to student records, including data retrieval, analysis, and management.
- `database.csv`: This csv file contains all the data about the students

### Directory 2: `Assignment3`

- Description: This directory includes several python scripts like a random password generator, a password checker, sentence tranformer and a restaurant billing script.
- [https://github.com/mercury-5/Python_Scripts/tree/main/Assignment3](/Assignment3)

#### Included Python Scripts

- `restaurant_billing_script.py`: This script takes the menu inforamtion from the csv file and takes order from the user and according to the order it prepares the bill with 18% GST.
